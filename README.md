# Animal-Shelter-EDA
Using a dataset from an animal shelter, this is a short exploratory data analysis (EDA) study. The dataset includes details about the animals brought into the shelter, such as their breed, colour, age, and result (e.g., MonthYear, Condition on intake, etc).

In this study, we explored numerous questions in order to acquire insights into the data, such as:


What breeds of animals are most frequently brought into the shelter?
What is the breakdown of the animals' ages in the shelter?
Which breeds are admitted to the shelter the most frequently?
What results do the animals in the shelter experience?
We used Python and a number of tools, including pandas, matplotlib, to do data cleaning, visualisation, and analysis in order to address these problems. We have developed a number of graphics,to comprehend the data better, use visual representations like pie charts, bar charts, and histograms.

The animal shelter EDA.ipynb notebook in this repository contains the code and analysis findings. The raw data utilised in the analysis can also be found in the animal shelter.csv file.

We anticipate that this EDA initiative will be beneficial for anyone looking to learn more about statistics from animal shelters and consider how they may assist animals in need.
